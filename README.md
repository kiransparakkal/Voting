# Voting

Background:
 In a voting setting, we have a set of 
 agents and a set of 
 alternatives. Every agent has a preference ordering 
 where 
 means that the agent prefers alternative 
 to alternative 
. A preference profile is a set of 
 preference orderings, one for every agent.

For example, if we have a voting setting with 4 agents and 4 alternatives, one possible preference profile could be the following:

A voting rule is a function that takes as input the preferences of a set of agents and outputs a winning alternative.

Consider the following voting rules:
